Summary:

We started this module with a question about pulsars. How many pulsars were emitting at the radio frequencies detected by the MWA. Initially, our investigation showed that most were not detected. But we decided to use a clever technique called stacking to improve our signal to noise ratio and make a statistical detection of the invisible population.

Setting out on this mission, we implemented a really simple mean stacking program and then decided to extend it to a median stack, as the median can be a more robust statistic. Implementing the median stack on a small amount of data was fine, but when we increased the data size, things immediately became problematic.

This is a really typical situation in modern science. Even a scientist who does not consider themselves a computational scientist or programmer has to work out how to analyze data efficiently.

There are many different technologies that are important and it's important that you have a good toolkit available to help you solve the problems. But, in this course, we want to focus on the underlying approach to problem solving, and this is often called computational thinking.

Computational thinking allows you to identify the problem, think about ways of framing problems computationally, think about possible solutions, and also be aware of the pitfalls of different solutions. In this case, running out of memory on your computer.

You can apply this approach to any data problems you encounter in your studies or your research. Being able to think about data and algorithms gives you a huge advantage in whatever you choose to do next.

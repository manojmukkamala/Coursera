Summary:

We started this module with a question about exoplanets when we asked 'How many of the earth sized exoplanets discovered so far lie in the habitable zone of their host star?' 

These the planets with the potential to harbor life and finding them is a very active area of scientific research. 

Questions like ours lend themselves to filtering data, and as we have seen, there can be an abundance of data about each object. And to answer questions you need easy access to the data relevant to your science. 

This is true not only in exoplanetary science, but across a broad array of disciplines. Sometimes information is missing, so we have to deal with NULL values. And sometimes data is duplicated, leaving multiple entries of the same information. 

You should now possess the skills to handle these cases and be able to extract only the data that you want. With these skills, we have explored the NASA Exoplanet Archive and seen the extreme diversity of exoplanet properties. With space missions like TESS and the James Webb Space Telescope, exoplanetary data will continue to pour in, so efficient organization of those data will only increase in importance. 

We've seen how databases provide that organizational framework. You'll come across databases in all aspects of life, including in most major scientific projects. Most of the time you'll have a user friendly interface, such as a webpage that you can use to query the database. 

However, sometimes you want more flexibility and control. Understanding how you can query databases directly using SQL opens up a whole new way of working with data, without the limitations of other peoples' thinking. You can now explore huge archives of data, both in astronomy and beyond in the rapidly expanding data science industry.
